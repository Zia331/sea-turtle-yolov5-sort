# sea-turtle-yolov5-sort

This project has 3 major steps to achieve the purpose of getting the total amount of sea turtles in a drone video.

1. Detecting the sea turtles using YOLOv5.
2. Tracking the sea turtles detected using SORT algorithm.
3. Calculate the threshold for the video to minimize the counting error.

After these 3 steps, we get the number of sea turtles detected in a given drone video.
